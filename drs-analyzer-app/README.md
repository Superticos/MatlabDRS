# DRS Analyzer Application

## Overview
The DRS Analyzer is a Python application designed for analyzing Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) data. It provides functionalities for loading, processing, plotting, and analyzing spectral data.

## Features
- Load DRS data from CSV files.
- Process raw data with averaging.
- Plot DRS and Î”DRS spectra.
- Perform peak analysis and track peak evolution.
- Export averaged DRS data and create GIF animations of the spectra.
